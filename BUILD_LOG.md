# Tractova Build Log

> **Single source of truth.** Tell Claude **"update build log"** and it appends the latest commit, flips backlog items to shipped, and updates the migration list. No more juggling Running_Notes / V3_Plan / V2_Plan / Prop_Plan — those are archived in `docs/archive/`.

## 🟢 Pickup after break — visual verification + apply migration 038

**Last session ended 2026-04-30 ~16:05 UTC** with a Playwright smoke
suite shipped (`79bfb08`) and the white-screen-on-state-click root-
caused + fixed (`09304d5`).

**Quick sanity check when you're back:**

1. **Visual verification on production** — Vercel should be on
   commit `79bfb08` by now. Walk these in order, takes 2 min:
   - `/dashboard` → click any state → confirm StateDetailPanel
     opens cleanly (was white-screening before `09304d5`)
   - `/search` → run a Lens analysis → look at:
     a) Sub-score bars (Offtake/IX/Site Control) — shimmer should
        flow continuously left-to-right with no perceived loop
        boundary or "jump" (CSS keyframes vs motion). Slowed to 6s
        per sweep.
     b) Feasibility ArcGauge — tick marks now sit OUTSIDE the green
        arc instead of crossing through it. Gauge should read as
        one unified object, not arc + scale labels.
   - `/library` → expand any project → Audit tab → score_change
     duplicates collapse with "× N" badge, list capped at 8 with
     "Show earlier" expansion
   - `+ Peer state` chip in Lens scenarios → opens a styled custom
     dropdown (not the native browser select), each option shows
     state name + program / IX / LMI caption

2. **Apply migration 038 in Supabase** — `state_programs_snapshots`
   table for Wave 1.4 WoW deltas. The cron will start writing
   snapshots on the next Sunday run; deltas appear in Markets on
   the Move ~2 weeks after first snapshot.

3. **No active work in queue.** The buildout backlog from earlier
   today is fully closed (Wave 1.4 scaffolded, Search.jsx primitives
   reviewed and intentionally skipped, wetlands deferred with
   honest scope). When ready for new work, candidates are:
   - Pro-flow smoke tests (currently smoke covers unauth paths only)
   - Wetlands + farmland data layers (3-4 day data-acquisition R&D)
   - First-pass on the deferred backlog items as paying-user
     traction signals appear

**Run `npm run verify` before pushing any visible-feature change.**
That's the new discipline (memory: feedback_pre_push_verify.md).

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — Tailwind v4 + Vite 8 + shadcn integration

Cleaner than the BUILD_LOG plan estimated (~1.5h vs 3-5h budgeted)
because the codebase had **zero `@apply` usage**, no Tailwind plugins,
and a simple custom palette — the official codemod handled almost
everything mechanically.

**Three commits, merged to main as `475a095`:**

- `3e7df8e` — Tailwind v3.4.6 → v4.2.4, Vite 5.3.4 → 8.0.10. Codemod
  migrated 35 files. JS config (`tailwind.config.js`) replaced by
  CSS-first `@theme` block in `src/index.css`. Class-name renames:
  `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0`, `focus:outline-none` →
  `focus:outline-hidden`, `rounded` → `rounded-sm`, `rounded-sm` →
  `rounded-xs`. Border-color compat shim added (v4 default changed
  from gray-200 to currentcolor). autoprefixer dropped (v4 has its
  own). Build time 22s → 4s thanks to Rolldown.

- `55f3fc7` — shadcn/ui integrated, scoped to its own directory at
  `src/components/shadcn/ui/` so primitives never collide with our
  existing custom UI in `src/components/ui/`. Pruned shadcn's
  universal CSS overrides (Geist font import, `* { @apply
  border-border }`, body/html @applies, `--font-sans` /
  `--color-primary` / `--color-accent` overrides in @theme inline).
  shadcn primitives now inherit our brand (teal primary, amber
  accent, Inter font) automatically. Smoke-test components: `card`,
  `badge`. Added `jsconfig.json` + `vite.config.js` `@/*` alias.

- `475a095` — merge commit.

**Audit impact:** vite + esbuild moderate vulns cleared (confirmed
locally). Remaining 6 high are all pre-documented accepted-risks
(`xlsx` + `react-simple-maps` / d3-color chain).

---

## ✅ Resolved 2026-04-30 — refresh pipeline + Census 503 saga

The data refresh that started yesterday with the NMTC wildcard bug is
now fully shipped. Diagnostic endpoint (`/api/refresh-data?debug=1`,
auth-bypass, fully redacted) confirmed Census API + key + Vercel
egress are all healthy: HTTP 200 in ~470ms with valid ACS data. User
clicked Refresh → **5/5 endpoints OK in 20.7s**, all 8 sub-sources ✓.

The remaining work was the durability layer — **stale-tolerance** for
the three Census handlers (`d8be8ef`). When Census 503s and our last
successful pull is <90 days old, the panel goes amber with a
`stale-ok · last good Nd ago` badge instead of red. ACS publishes
annually so this is the right semantics. Server keeps `ok: false` on
the actual failure so `cron_runs` records honestly and the next
stale-check finds the real last-good run.

## Status snapshot

- **Branch:** `main` · last commit: `79bfb08` Smoke tests: Playwright suite catches runtime bugs that pass build
- **Live data layers (all .gov / authoritative-source verified):**
  - `lmi_data` (state-level Census ACS)
  - `county_acs_data` (3,142 counties Census ACS)
  - `state_programs` + DSIRE verification
  - `revenue_stacks` + DSIRE verification
  - `news_feed` (RSS + Claude Haiku 4.5 classifier)
  - `energy_community_data` (DOE NETL EDX — IRA §45/§48 +10% ITC)
  - `hud_qct_dda_data` (HUD User — LIHTC LMI overlay)
  - `nmtc_lic_data` (Census ACS + CDFI methodology — IRA §48(e) Cat 1 +10% ITC)
  - `ix_queue_data` (ISO/RTO weekly scrapers)
  - `substations` (EIA Form 860 monthly)
  - `revenue_rates` (NREL PVWatts + EIA quarterly)
- **Multiplexed cron:** Two staggered Sunday runs to fit Hobby gateway window — `?source=fast` at 07:00 (7 quick sources) + `?source=nmtc_lic` at 07:30 (NMTC alone, ~50-70s due to 51-state iteration). Plus 3 separate cron functions for substations / IX queue / capacity factors (Hobby 12-function cap).
- **Admin manual refresh:** `/admin > Data Health > Refresh data from sources` parallel-fans-out to all **5 endpoints** (fast bundle + NMTC + substations + ix_queue + capacity) with admin JWT auth. Each endpoint has its own gateway window so a slow source can't drag the rest.

## Backlog (priority-ranked)

### P1 — Scaffolding shipped 2026-04-30; lights up automatically as data history accrues
- **Markets on the Move WoW deltas** — ✅ scaffolding shipped (`5c30369`). Migration 038 (`state_programs_snapshots`) appends a row per active-CS state on every `state_programs` cron run. UI pulls the deltas via `getStateProgramDeltas()` and renders ↑/↓ pt arrows when ≥2 snapshots exist per state. Falls back to the recency sort + "Xd ago" caption until then. Data accrues automatically; first deltas appear ~2 weeks after migration 038 lands.
- **IX Velocity Index + Program Saturation Index** (Wave 1.4 derived metrics) — `ix_queue_snapshots` accumulating since 2026-04-28 (migration 012 already shipped). Computation logic is the only piece pending; once we have ≥4 weeks of history we'll add an RPC and a chip on the IX card. Readiness recheck **scheduled for 2026-06-03** via /loop agent.
- **Trend chips on KPIs (MetricsBar)** — same pattern: needs `dashboard_metrics_snapshots` history. Revisit when prioritized; the same scaffolding template (migration + cron hook + delta helper) used for `state_programs_snapshots` applies here.

### P2 — Closed: existing solution is correct
- ~~**Search.jsx form inputs → ui/* primitives**~~ — **Reviewed 2026-04-30, deliberately not refactored.** Search.jsx already uses clean `FieldSelect`, `CountyCombobox` field components with shared `labelCls`/`inputCls` Tailwind classes. The grid layout is intentionally dense (5-column on desktop) and forcing the project's `Input.jsx` primitive (designed for stacked-label layout) would degrade not improve. The "deferred to natural touches" guideline in the V3 plan is the right call — substitute incrementally as new fields are added, not as a bulk rewrite.

### P2 — Engineering-ready (real work)
- **Wetlands + farmland data layers** (EPA NWI / USDA WSS) — multi-day data-acquisition + spatial-join work. EPA National Wetlands Inventory dataset is US-wide, USDA Web Soil Survey has a tile API. Approach: pre-compute per-county wetland coverage % and prime-farmland % into a new Supabase table at refresh time (avoid live API on every Lens query). Revisit when Lens Site Control card needs more depth than the current 4 status tiles. Estimated 3-4 days for ingest + spatial-join + UI integration.

### P3 — Pre-revenue legal / IP (non-engineering, no monthly subscriptions per user preference)
- Hand-roll **Privacy Policy + Terms of Service** (avoiding Termly/Iubenda monthly).
- **LLC formation** before significant revenue.
- **USPTO trademark filing** for "Tractova" wordmark (~$500 flat-fee attorney).
- **Defensive domain registrations** (.io / .app / .ai / typos).

### Accepted dependency risks (dependabot will keep flagging — context here)

| Package | Severity | Why we accept | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xlsx` | high (proto pollution + ReDoS) | Vulns require **parsing** malicious workbooks. We only **write** xlsx (Library export). No npm patch — SheetJS left npm in 2023. | Replace with `exceljs` only if we add xlsx import. Otherwise indefinite. |
| `react-simple-maps` chain (`d3-color` ReDoS) | high ×4 | ReDoS needs user-controlled color strings; we pass static us-atlas topojson. Library abandoned at v3; npm flags downgrade to v1 as the only "fix". | Swap for `@nivo/geo` or similar if the map needs new features. |
| ~~`vite` / `esbuild`~~ | ~~mod ×2~~ | ~~Dev-server-only vulns.~~ | ✅ **Resolved 2026-04-30** by Vite 5→8 upgrade (`3e7df8e`). |

### Deferred until paying-user traction
- **IX Queue Forecaster** (Wave 2 — needs ≥12 weekly snapshots, Q3 launch).
- **Comparable Deals DB** (~30+ Pro users justify build).
- **PUC dockets full crawl** (per-state portals, high curation cost).
- **OpenEI URDB integration** (utility tariff schedules — scale + utility-territory mapping issue).
- **§48(e) Categories 2-4** (Indian Land + low-income residential + economic benefit) — Cat 1 covers most CS projects; 2-4 require additional data layers.

## How to update this file

When the user says **"update build log"**, **"log this"**, **"save what we did"**, or similar, Claude should:

1. Run `git log --oneline -5` (or check session memory for new commits) and **prepend** any new commits to the Recent builds table.
2. Update **Pending migrations** — if a new `03X` SQL file was created, add it as ⏳; if user confirmed they ran SQL, flip the relevant row(s) to ✅.
3. Update **Status snapshot** — bump last-commit hash + subject; update the live-data-layers list if a new one shipped or one was removed.
4. Move any **Backlog** items that just shipped into Recent builds (delete from backlog).
5. Add new backlog items if the session generated them.
6. Keep the file concise — if Recent builds exceeds ~25 rows, move the bottom 5 to a "older builds" section or trim into `docs/archive/Running_Notes.md`.

That's the entire protocol. No other planning docs to maintain.
