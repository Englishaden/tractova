## 🟢 Pickup — Launch-readiness audit cleared, NWI catch-up running

**Session 2026-05-01 (long block, ~10h).** Path B shipped earlier in the
session, then an end-to-end launch-readiness audit produced a 70/100 score
with 10 must-fix items. All 10 are now shipped across three thematic
sessions, plus the operational lessons from the first NWI seed run.

**Today's commits on `main` (most recent first):**

```
5fa13c7  Audit follow-ups: profile defaults, priceId guard, seed --parallel flag
3539511  Session 3 audit fixes: silent failure sweep
5f70330  Session 2 audit fixes: data integrity cluster
14f92b2  Session 1 audit fixes: onboarding + auth + paywall + first-run
dc85c18  BUILD_LOG: cron-runs latency monitor → P2 backlog
d50c9fd  Admin: visible feedback on Copy report / Copy / Copy JSON buttons
bbc9543  Fix substations 504: parallelize per-state EIA calls
9902f51  Fix HTTP 500 on refresh-data: duplicate `const usps`
5b17f89  Fix geospatial_farmland: per-state SSURGO batching
3a11235  BUILD_LOG: Path B + migration 039 + 3-step prod activation
7c49c5c  Path B: county_geospatial_data — wetlands + farmland for all 50 states
```

**To light up Path B on prod (still pending Aden's action):**

1. **Run migration 039** in Supabase SQL editor (paste
   `supabase/migrations/039_county_geospatial_data.sql`). Inert until rows
   exist — does not change scoring behavior.
2. **Trigger the SSURGO ingest** via the admin Refresh button (or wait for
   Sunday 7:45 cron). Populates ~3,000 counties with `prime_farmland_pct`
   in ~5s. After this, `availableLand` is live for all 50 states (AK
   skipped per migration comment).
3. **NWI catch-up running in background** (PARALLEL=2 after the first
   run hit NWI server-side throttling — 730/3144 succeeded, 2414 timed
   out). The catch-up `--refresh --parallel=2` invocation processes only
   the missing rows; ETA ~3-4h on the gentler parallelism.

**Audit punch list status (was 10 must-fix, now 0):**

| # | Item | Commit |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | UpgradeSuccess first-time Pro guided action (biggest conversion lever) | 14f92b2 |
| 2 | Landing hero ApiErrorBanner instead of swallowed catches | 14f92b2 |
| 3 | Cross-tab cache invalidation after admin Refresh (BroadcastChannel) | 5f70330 |
| 4 | scoreEngine null-input → midpoint instead of optimistic favorable | 5f70330 |
| 5 | Library getAlerts uses same countyData inputs as card display | 5f70330 |
| 6 | /update-password route (Supabase password reset target) | 14f92b2 |
| 7 | UpgradePrompt LensPreview component (paywall now shows the output) | 14f92b2 |
| 8 | Search PUC + Comparable panel error logging (curation-gated, intentional hide) | 3539511 |
| 9 | useSubscription hardened: maybeSingle + .catch → free-tier default | 5fa13c7 |
| 10 | create-checkout-session priceId allowlist (env-gated server-side check) | 5fa13c7 |

Plus the silent-failure sweep (Glossary copy feedback, CompareTray AI
error visible, console.warn for graceful-degrade helpers).

**Visual verification on prod after Vercel redeploys:**
- New `/update-password` route — Supabase reset-password emails now land
  on a real form instead of 404
- Landing hero amber banner if both metrics fetches fail (with Retry)
- UpgradeSuccess for first-time Pro shows guided "Run the example" card
  with pre-filled Will County demo, not a blank /search dump
- Paywall has a static LensPreview card showing the actual report layout
- Compare modal AI block shows a clear "AI comparison unavailable" amber
  block instead of vanishing on error
- Glossary term-link copy shows "Copied" / "Copy failed" inline

**Next pickup options (priority-ordered):**

- **NWI catch-up monitoring** — re-check in ~3-4h once `--refresh
  --parallel=2` finishes; if still incomplete, drop to `--parallel=1`.
- **Drill-down geospatial detail in the Site Control card** — when a user
  expands the Site Control card, surface `wetland_coverage_pct`,
  `wetland_category`, `prime_farmland_pct` + sources alongside curated
  notes. ~1-2h.
- **Activate §48(e) / HUD layers in Lens scoring UI** — data live (3,144
  NMTC + 1,801 HUD rows). Needs to flow into the offtake panel as ITC-
  bonus indicators. ~3-4h.
- **Expand IX scrapers to missing CS-active states** (CA, FL, WA, HI, NM,
  CT, RI, MI, WI, OR, VA) — would grow IX · Live from 8 → 19. Multi-
  session per-ISO scraper work.
- **Cron-runs latency monitor** (P2 backlog, see `dc85c18`) — proactive
  scan to catch the next 504-class bug before users do.
- **Path-toward-50-states-fully-live**: site (✅) → IX (scraper expansion)
  → utility serving (EIA Form 861) → offtake (EIA retail rates).

## ✅ Shipped 2026-05-01 — Path B: county_geospatial_data (`7c49c5c`)

**Single large commit closing out a multi-session estimate in one session.**
Pre-work probes (in `scripts/probe-fips-conventions.mjs` and
`scripts/probe-geospatial.mjs`) validated the approach before touching
production code: confirmed all 4 county-keyed tables share `county_fips`
text PK with leading zeros, validated the USFWS NWI ArcGIS outStatistics
query against `Wetlands.ACRES` table-qualified, validated the USDA SSURGO
T-SQL aggregate of `farmlndcl IN (...)` returning whole-state prime-farmland
percentages in <100ms.

**`7c49c5c` — Path B build.** Replaces the silent `site=60` fallback for the
32 states that lack a `county_intelligence` default row with derived
signals from authoritative federal sources, covering all 3,142 counties.

- **Migration 039** — `county_geospatial_data` table keyed on `county_fips`,
  fields `wetland_coverage_pct`, `wetland_category`, `prime_farmland_pct`,
  separate `*_last_updated` timestamps because the two sources refresh at
  different cadences. Wetland category is bucketed (minimal/moderate/
  significant/severe) since raw NWI % can exceed 100% from polygon overlap
  + water inclusion (calibrated thresholds in the migration comment).
- **SSURGO refresh** — wired into the multiplexed `refresh-data.js` as
  `?source=geospatial_farmland`. Single T-SQL aggregate query covers the
  whole US in ~5s. New 7:45 Sunday cron entry. AK skipped (137 NRCS
  regions vs 30 boroughs); CT/RI handled as statewide single-area
  assignments to all counties via `county_acs_data`.
- **NWI seed** — `scripts/seed-county-geospatial-nwi.mjs`. Runs locally
  with 4x parallelism (~1.5h for 3,142 counties — too long for the 300s
  Vercel ceiling). Idempotent + resumable via `--refresh` flag (skips
  counties updated within 90 days).
- **scoreEngine** — three-layer site sub-score: live geospatial → curated
  `county_intelligence` → `site=60` baseline. Backward-compatible — when
  geospatial row is absent, the curated path runs with no behavior change.
  `coverage.site = 'live'|'researched'|'fallback'` exposed.
- **programData.getCountyData** — augmented to fetch `county_geospatial_data`
  via `county_fips` (resolved through `county_acs_data`, same FIPS bridge
  as `getNmtcLic`/`getHudQctDda`) and merge as `countyData.geospatial`.
  No frontend changes required — the data block just gets richer.
- **lens-insight context** — when geospatial is present, the AI prompt
  receives live numeric inputs (prime farmland %, wetland coverage %,
  NWI feature count) and an explicit `COVERAGE: live geospatial` line so
  the dossier reasons honestly about authoritative sources.
- **UI** — small teal **"Site · Live"** pill in the Lens result eyebrow,
  mirroring the IX · Live treatment. Radix tooltip explains inputs +
  thresholds. Absent (honest signal) for counties without a geospatial row.

`npm run verify` green (build + 7 smoke tests, ~12s).

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — IX score live-blend + Lens loader polish

Three commits closing out the long evening session. Together they shift
the IX sub-score from purely curated to a calibrated blend of curated +
live ISO/RTO queue signals, surface that honestly in the UI, and fix
the Lens loader stall.

**`e9506a7` — IX score live-blend.** `computeSubScores` now optionally
accepts an `ixQueueSummary` arg. When present + non-empty, applies a
clamped (±10) adjustment based on `avg_study_months` and total
`mw_pending`. Thresholds calibrated from the actual `ix_queue_data`
distribution (probe: `scripts/probe-ix-queue.mjs`):
- avg_study_months: <14mo +5 / 14-19 0 / 20-23 -3 / 24+ -8
- total mw_pending: <500 +3 / 500-999 0 / 1000-1499 -3 / 1500+ -6

New `coverage.ix = 'live' | 'curated'` flag. Library + Profile call
sites pass 4 args (no ixQueueSummary), so they stay on curated path.
Search.jsx passes the already-fetched `results.ixQueueSummary` →
Lens-only live blend, no regression elsewhere. Coverage today: 8 of
50 states (CO/IL/MA/MD/ME/MN/NJ/NY) — concentrated on the highest-
volume CS markets.

**`7d474e1` — IX · Live tooltip polish.** Replaced the native browser
`title` attribute with a Radix portal tooltip styled to match the
methodology popover at `Search.jsx:479` — dark navy bg, teal border,
structured headings + INPUTS / CLAMP / coverage-policy footnote.
Reads as research-note documentation, matching the Lens chrome
convention.

**`e4c6666` — Lens loader asymptote.** Halo arc was `p = (elapsed/14s)*88`
linear-then-stop, which produced a visible stall at 88% on every run.
Replaced with `p = 95 * (1 - exp(-elapsed/8s))` and removed the RAF
exit guard. Result: motion never freezes (sub-pixel asymptotic creep
even on 60s outliers), and the snap-to-100% on completion always has
5+ points of headroom for a clean landing.

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — Library WoW + freshness signal

Two retention-driving surfaces added on the Library page in parallel
to the Dashboard hero indicator (`e2c8b48`):

**Freshness signal** — small mono "Data refreshed [date]" caption with
teal breathing dot under the hero meta line. Amber when underlying
program data is >14d old. Tooltip explains scores are recomputed from
this snapshot on every load. Same retention rationale as the Dashboard
version: Library is the daily-driver surface, so the live-data promise
needs to stay visible on the user's main return loop.

**WoW score-delta chip** — when a saved project's state has moved
week-over-week in `state_programs_snapshots`, a "State ±N pt" pill
renders in the project-card chip row. Teal up / amber down. Honestly
labeled "State" because the source is state-level program snapshots,
not per-project history; tooltip explains the project's blended score
may differ. Falls back to silent when delta is null/zero — no visual
noise pre-data. Lights up automatically once history accrues (~2 weeks
post-migration-038).

**One file changed:** `src/pages/Library.jsx` (~50 LOC). No new RPC,
no new migration, no new dependency — piggybacks on the existing
`getStateProgramDeltas()` already shipped for Markets on the Move
(`5c30369`). Verified via `npm run verify:full` (14 tests green).

---

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — Pro-flow smoke tests (`5b6a7a0`)

Five files changed:

- `tests/auth.setup.js` (new) — drives `/signin` with creds from `.env.local`,
  saves storage state to `tests/.auth/pro-user.json`
- `tests/pro-smoke.spec.js` (new) — 6 tests covering home (Dashboard
  resolution), Search past paywall, Library past paywall, Library
  empty-state preview, Profile + Pro-badge, /preview when authed
- `playwright.config.js` — added `setup` + `pro-chromium` projects with
  glob testMatch
- `package.json` scripts — `test:smoke` now unauth-only; new
  `test:smoke:pro`, `test:smoke:all`, `verify:full`. `npm run verify`
  unchanged (build + unauth smoke).
- `.gitignore` += `tests/.auth/`. `.env.example` += test-account setup
  instructions.

**Before committing — one-time setup the user must do:**

1. **Create the test account** in the live app (sign up via UI, e.g.
   `smoke-test@tractova.com` with any password).
2. **Flip it to Pro** via Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   update profiles
      set subscription_tier='pro',
          subscription_status='active'
    where id = (select id from auth.users where email='smoke-test@tractova.com');
   ```
3. **Drop creds in `.env.local`:**
   ```
   TEST_USER_EMAIL=smoke-test@tractova.com
   TEST_USER_PASSWORD=<the password>
   ```
4. **Run `npm run test:smoke:pro`** — should pass 6 tests in ~10-15s.
5. **Then `npm run verify:full`** to confirm the full suite is green
   before committing.

**`npm run verify` keeps working with no creds set.** It runs build +
unauth smoke (the existing 7 tests). Use `verify:full` once Pro creds
are in place.

**No live API calls in any test.** Lens form submissions are deliberately
not exercised — the smoke is render-and-watch-for-console-errors. Cost
per run: $0.

**Deferred items, in priority order (unchanged from prior session):**
- **Library WoW score deltas + freshness signal** (parallel to
  Dashboard hero) — ~2 hours, retention-driving.
- **Expand curated economic coverage to top-10 solar markets**
  (CA, TX, FL, NC, AZ, GA, NV, NM) — biggest single-move leverage.
  EIA Form 861 + ISO capacity markets publicly sourced. ~4-8h/state.
- **Apply pending migrations 034-037** (HUD QCT/DDA + NMTC LIC) in
  Supabase SQL editor.
- **Wetlands + farmland data layers** — 3-4 day R&D + spatial join.

**Coverage gap (unchanged):** only 18 of 50 states have a `default`
county_intelligence row. Missing: AK, AL, AR, AZ, DE, GA, IA, ID, IN,
KS, KY, LA, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NV, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN,
TX, UT, VT, WI, WV, WY.

**Run `npm run verify` before pushing any visible-feature change.**

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — Score honesty pass (`596de4b` + `d4061d2`)

**Two layered fixes** addressing the same trust-erosion class:
silent baseline fallbacks in the Lens scoring engine that produced
research-grade-looking numbers from placeholder values.

### `596de4b` — offtake coverage
**The bug.** Customer could pick BESS/C&I/Hybrid for any of 50
states in `/search`. `CI_OFFTAKE_SCORES` (12 states) and
`BESS_OFFTAKE_SCORES` (10 states) silently fell back to 55/45 for
uncovered states. The revenue panel honestly said "model not
available" but the feasibility number looked researched.

**The fix.** `computeSubScores` returns `coverage: { offtake }`.
`MarketPositionPanel` renders a "Limited offtake coverage" caption
listing curated states. `api/lens-insight.js` adds a `COVERAGE
NOTE` instructing the AI to speak directionally for uncovered
geographies (no fabricated $/kW or PPA cents/kWh).

### `d4061d2` — site coverage (parallel)
**The bug.** Only 18 of 50 states have a `default`
county_intelligence row seeded. For the other 32 states, the Site
Control sub-score silently defaults to 60. Same trust issue.

**The fix.** `coverage.site` = `'researched' | 'fallback'`. The
caption block consolidated into one "Limited coverage — directional
only" panel with per-pillar bullets (offtake, site) so common-case
where both fire stays visually clean.

**What this didn't change.** All 50 states still receive full Lens
analysis on the data side. State programs all 50, IX difficulty all
50, IRA/HUD/NMTC overlays all 50. Only the **economic** and
**county-level site** layers honestly signal coverage now.

## ✅ Shipped 2026-04-30 — Tailwind v4 + Vite 8 + shadcn integration

Cleaner than the BUILD_LOG plan estimated (~1.5h vs 3-5h budgeted)
because the codebase had **zero `@apply` usage**, no Tailwind plugins,
and a simple custom palette — the official codemod handled almost
everything mechanically.

**Three commits, merged to main as `475a095`:**

- `3e7df8e` — Tailwind v3.4.6 → v4.2.4, Vite 5.3.4 → 8.0.10. Codemod
  migrated 35 files. JS config (`tailwind.config.js`) replaced by
  CSS-first `@theme` block in `src/index.css`. Class-name renames:
  `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0`, `focus:outline-none` →
  `focus:outline-hidden`, `rounded` → `rounded-sm`, `rounded-sm` →
  `rounded-xs`. Border-color compat shim added (v4 default changed
  from gray-200 to currentcolor). autoprefixer dropped (v4 has its
  own). Build time 22s → 4s thanks to Rolldown.

- `55f3fc7` — shadcn/ui integrated, scoped to its own directory at
  `src/components/shadcn/ui/` so primitives never collide with our
  existing custom UI in `src/components/ui/`. Pruned shadcn's
  universal CSS overrides (Geist font import, `* { @apply
  border-border }`, body/html @applies, `--font-sans` /
  `--color-primary` / `--color-accent` overrides in @theme inline).
  shadcn primitives now inherit our brand (teal primary, amber
  accent, Inter font) automatically. Smoke-test components: `card`,
  `badge`. Added `jsconfig.json` + `vite.config.js` `@/*` alias.

- `475a095` — merge commit.

**Audit impact:** vite + esbuild moderate vulns cleared (confirmed
locally). Remaining 6 high are all pre-documented accepted-risks
(`xlsx` + `react-simple-maps` / d3-color chain).

---

## ✅ Resolved 2026-04-30 — refresh pipeline + Census 503 saga

The data refresh that started yesterday with the NMTC wildcard bug is
now fully shipped. Diagnostic endpoint (`/api/refresh-data?debug=1`,
auth-bypass, fully redacted) confirmed Census API + key + Vercel
egress are all healthy: HTTP 200 in ~470ms with valid ACS data. User
clicked Refresh → **5/5 endpoints OK in 20.7s**, all 8 sub-sources ✓.

The remaining work was the durability layer — **stale-tolerance** for
the three Census handlers (`d8be8ef`). When Census 503s and our last
successful pull is <90 days old, the panel goes amber with a
`stale-ok · last good Nd ago` badge instead of red. ACS publishes
annually so this is the right semantics. Server keeps `ok: false` on
the actual failure so `cron_runs` records honestly and the next
stale-check finds the real last-good run.

---

## Status snapshot

- **Branch:** `main` · last commit: pending — visual polish + landing alignment
- **Live data layers (all .gov / authoritative-source verified):**
  - `lmi_data` (state-level Census ACS)
  - `county_acs_data` (3,142 counties Census ACS)
  - `state_programs` + DSIRE verification
  - `revenue_stacks` + DSIRE verification
  - `news_feed` (RSS + Claude Haiku 4.5 classifier)
  - `energy_community_data` (DOE NETL EDX — IRA §45/§48 +10% ITC)
  - `hud_qct_dda_data` (HUD User — LIHTC LMI overlay)
  - `nmtc_lic_data` (Census ACS + CDFI methodology — IRA §48(e) Cat 1 +10% ITC)
  - `ix_queue_data` (ISO/RTO weekly scrapers)
  - `substations` (EIA Form 860 monthly)
  - `revenue_rates` (NREL PVWatts + EIA quarterly)
- **Multiplexed cron:** Two staggered Sunday runs to fit Hobby gateway window — `?source=fast` at 07:00 (7 quick sources) + `?source=nmtc_lic` at 07:30 (NMTC alone, ~50-70s due to 51-state iteration). Plus 3 separate cron functions for substations / IX queue / capacity factors (Hobby 12-function cap).
- **Admin manual refresh:** `/admin > Data Health > Refresh data from sources` parallel-fans-out to all **5 endpoints** (fast bundle + NMTC + substations + ix_queue + capacity) with admin JWT auth. Each endpoint has its own gateway window so a slow source can't drag the rest.

## Backlog (priority-ranked)

### P1 — Scaffolding shipped 2026-04-30; lights up automatically as data history accrues
- **Markets on the Move WoW deltas** — ✅ scaffolding shipped (`5c30369`). Migration 038 (`state_programs_snapshots`) appends a row per active-CS state on every `state_programs` cron run. UI pulls the deltas via `getStateProgramDeltas()` and renders ↑/↓ pt arrows when ≥2 snapshots exist per state. Falls back to the recency sort + "Xd ago" caption until then. Data accrues automatically; first deltas appear ~2 weeks after migration 038 lands.
- **Library project-card WoW chip** — ✅ scaffolding shipped (this session). Same data source as Markets on the Move; renders a "State ±N pt" pill on each card whose state has moved between weekly snapshots. Honestly labeled "State" because deltas are state-program-level, not per-project. Silent until snapshot history accrues.
- **IX Velocity Index + Program Saturation Index** (Wave 1.4 derived metrics) — `ix_queue_snapshots` accumulating since 2026-04-28 (migration 012 already shipped). Computation logic is the only piece pending; once we have ≥4 weeks of history we'll add an RPC and a chip on the IX card. Readiness recheck **scheduled for 2026-06-03** via /loop agent.
- **Trend chips on KPIs (MetricsBar)** — same pattern: needs `dashboard_metrics_snapshots` history. Revisit when prioritized; the same scaffolding template (migration + cron hook + delta helper) used for `state_programs_snapshots` applies here.

### P2 — Closed: existing solution is correct
- ~~**Search.jsx form inputs → ui/* primitives**~~ — **Reviewed 2026-04-30, deliberately not refactored.** Search.jsx already uses clean `FieldSelect`, `CountyCombobox` field components with shared `labelCls`/`inputCls` Tailwind classes. The grid layout is intentionally dense (5-column on desktop) and forcing the project's `Input.jsx` primitive (designed for stacked-label layout) would degrade not improve. The "deferred to natural touches" guideline in the V3 plan is the right call — substitute incrementally as new fields are added, not as a bulk rewrite.

### P2 — Engineering-ready (real work)
- **Cron-runs latency monitor** — recurring agent (weekly cron or `/schedule`) that scans `cron_runs.duration_ms` p95s for each `cron_name` and flags any source whose p95 exceeds 70% of its function `maxDuration`. Surfaces in admin Data Health (or via PR/email). Catches the *next* `refresh-substations`-class 504 before it ships — the structural class of bug ("sequential per-state calls under a tight function budget") is invisible to syntax/smoke checks; it only shows up under upstream slowness, by which point users see a red panel. Implementation sketch: a `/api/check-cron-latency` endpoint that selects the last 8 successful runs per `cron_name` and computes p95 vs the corresponding vercel.json `maxDuration`; exits with a structured warning summary the admin UI can render. Estimated 2-3h. Pairs naturally with the existing `cron_runs` telemetry already populated by every refresh handler.
- **Wetlands + farmland data layers** (EPA NWI / USDA WSS) — ✅ shipped 2026-05-01 as Path B (`7c49c5c`).

### P3 — Pre-revenue legal / IP (non-engineering, no monthly subscriptions per user preference)
- Hand-roll **Privacy Policy + Terms of Service** (avoiding Termly/Iubenda monthly).
- **LLC formation** before significant revenue.
- **USPTO trademark filing** for "Tractova" wordmark (~$500 flat-fee attorney).
- **Defensive domain registrations** (.io / .app / .ai / typos).

### Accepted dependency risks (dependabot will keep flagging — context here)

| Package | Severity | Why we accept | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xlsx` | high (proto pollution + ReDoS) | Vulns require **parsing** malicious workbooks. We only **write** xlsx (Library export). No npm patch — SheetJS left npm in 2023. | Replace with `exceljs` only if we add xlsx import. Otherwise indefinite. |
| `react-simple-maps` chain (`d3-color` ReDoS) | high ×4 | ReDoS needs user-controlled color strings; we pass static us-atlas topojson. Library abandoned at v3; npm flags downgrade to v1 as the only "fix". | Swap for `@nivo/geo` or similar if the map needs new features. |
| ~~`vite` / `esbuild`~~ | ~~mod ×2~~ | ~~Dev-server-only vulns.~~ | ✅ **Resolved 2026-04-30** by Vite 5→8 upgrade (`3e7df8e`). |

### Deferred until paying-user traction
- **IX Queue Forecaster** (Wave 2 — needs ≥12 weekly snapshots, Q3 launch).
- **Comparable Deals DB** (~30+ Pro users justify build).
- **PUC dockets full crawl** (per-state portals, high curation cost).
- **OpenEI URDB integration** (utility tariff schedules — scale + utility-territory mapping issue).
- **§48(e) Categories 2-4** (Indian Land + low-income residential + economic benefit) — Cat 1 covers most CS projects; 2-4 require additional data layers.

## How to update this file

When the user says **"update build log"**, **"log this"**, **"save what we did"**, or similar, Claude should:

1. Run `git log --oneline -5` (or check session memory for new commits) and **prepend** any new commits to the Recent builds table.
2. Update **Pending migrations** — if a new `03X` SQL file was created, add it as ⏳; if user confirmed they ran SQL, flip the relevant row(s) to ✅.
3. Update **Status snapshot** — bump last-commit hash + subject; update the live-data-layers list if a new one shipped or one was removed.
4. Move any **Backlog** items that just shipped into Recent builds (delete from backlog).
5. Add new backlog items if the session generated them.
6. Keep the file concise — if Recent builds exceeds ~25 rows, move the bottom 5 to a "older builds" section or trim into `docs/archive/Running_Notes.md`.

That's the entire protocol. No other planning docs to maintain.
